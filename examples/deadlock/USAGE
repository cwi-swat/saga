1. Generate aspect and parser for attribute grammar, then compile all sources:
   mvn clean package
2. Start the program with assertions enabled (-ea) and antlr and aspectj in the classpath. The program executes until a deadlock is detected:
   java -cp target/lib/*:target/* -ea nl.cwi.saga.deadlock.Deadlock
